This is Net::DNS::ZoneFile, a module to help you usefully parse a
DNS zone file into the Net::DNS::RR objects that it contains.

(c) 2002 Luis E. Munoz <luismunoz@cpan.org>

This software can be used under the same terms as perl itself. It also
carries the same warranties.

To install,

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The $ORIGIN, $TTL and $GENERATE directives are fully supported.

Not all RR classes are supported, but most common ones are.

The author is glad to provide support to this module as his time
permits. Please send bug reports (or patches) as well as feedback and
suggestions to

luismunoz@cpan.org

When submitting parsing bugs, it is very important that you include
the shortest zone file that triggers the bug. This is probably the
fastest way to get help.

This module was developed under Perl 5.6.0. Earlier perls will require
you to manually modify the module, removing our-declarations.
